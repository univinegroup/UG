It's all in the name. When we came together as partners, we wanted a name that would represent our friendship, personality and desire to provide excellence in all that we do. After brainstorming together, several names made the final cut. Uni is having or consisting of one. We believed that in order for us to build a successful business to-gether, there has to be unity or oneness. Since we are equal partners, we highly value one another's opinion and contribution to the company. Vine is representative of strength and growth. Our desire is to see our company grow to its fullest potential.
